Challenge overview

The 2nd edition of AIM: Advances in Image Manipulation workshop will be held August 28, 2020 in conjunction with ECCV 2020 in Glasgow, UK.

Image manipulation is a key computer vision tasks, aiming at the restoration of degraded image content, the filling in of missing information, or the needed transformation and/or manipulation to achieve a desired target (with respect to perceptual quality, contents, or performance of apps working on such images). Recent years have witnessed an increased interest from the vision and graphics communities in these fundamental topics of research. Not only has there been a constantly growing flow of related papers, but also substantial progress has been achieved.

Each step forward eases the use of images by people or computers for the fulfillment of further tasks, as image manipulation serves as an important frontend. Not surprisingly then, there is an ever growing range of applications in fields such as surveillance, the automotive industry, electronics, remote sensing, or medical image analysis etc. The emergence and ubiquitous use of mobile and wearable devices offer another fertile ground for additional applications and faster methods.

This workshop aims to provide an overview of the new trends and advances in those areas. Moreover, it will offer an opportunity for academic and industrial attendees to interact and explore collaborations.

Jointly with AIM workshop we have an AIM challenge on examble-based single image inpainting, that is, the task of predicting the values of missing pixels in an image so that the completed result looks realistic and coherent. The challenge uses a modified version of the publicly available ADE20k dataset and has 2 tracks:

- Extreme Image Inpainting

- Extreme Image Inpainting guided by pixel-wise semantic labels

The aim is to obtain a network design / solution capable to produce high quality results with the best perceptual quality and similar to the reference ground truth.

 

The top ranked participants will be awarded and invited to follow the ECCV submission guide for workshops to describe their solution and to submit to the associated AIM workshop at ECCV 2020.

More details are found on the data section of the competition.
